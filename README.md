# Gaussian Mixture Technique Using Expectation Maximization

## Overview
The `GaussianMixtureTechnique` project, specifically the `expectation_maximization.ipynb` notebook, implements the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). This notebook, created using Colaboratory, demonstrates the application of GMMs in clustering and density estimation.

## Features
- **Expectation-Maximization Algorithm:** Implements EM to iteratively improve the estimation of Gaussian mixtures.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots and visual aids to demonstrate the behavior and results of the algorithm.

## Installation and Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akashdeepsaha03/GaussianMixtureTechnique.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Open the `expectation_maximization.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to observe the EM algorithm in action.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Libraries: Likely includes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and possibly scikit-learn or similar for machine learning tasks.
